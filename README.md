# A glimpse of Lean

This repository is an introduction to theorem proving in Lean for the impatient. 
The goal is to get a feel for what proving in Lean looks like in 2 or 3 hours.
After reading the `Introduction.lean` file, you should read explanations and do exercises in the 
`Basics` folder, and then choose to work on one file from the `Topics` folder.
Of course you can play with all files from that folder if you have more time.

If you have a lot more time, you should read the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) (but note that book is currently using the stable version of Lean, Lean 3, whereas this repository uses the brand new Lean 4 which is not yet fully ready for mathematical use).

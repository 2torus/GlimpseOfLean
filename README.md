# A glimpse of Lean

This repository is an introduction to theorem proving in Lean for the impatient.
The goal is to get a feel for what proving in Lean looks like in 2 or 3 hours,
or maybe devote half a day or a full day.

There are two tracks. Both start with reading the `Introduction.lean` file.

Then the short track continues in the `Shorter.lean` file which is meant to give
you access to not completely empty mathematical proofs in two hours if you are
ready to move really fast.

If you have a bit more time, you should instead read explanations and do
exercises in the `Basics` folder, and then choose to work on one file from the
`Topics` folder. Of course you can play with all files from that folder if you
have even more time.

To work using Lean, you either have to install Lean locally, or use a lean4web
server, or use Codespaces or use Gitpod.

* To use codespaces, make sure you're logged in to Github, click the button below, select `4-core`, and then press `Create codespace`. After a few minutes an editor with Lean working will open in your browser.

* Gitpod is very similar to Codespaces, click the button below, press `Continue` and wait a few minutes.

* To install Lean locally, follow the instructions [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

If you have a lot more time, you should read the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/).
